Face Mask Prediction using YOLOv5
This project involves the development of a deep learning model for detecting whether individuals are wearing face masks properly, improperly, or not at all. The model is built using the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) architecture, which is one of the most advanced real-time object detection models available.

Introduction
In recent years, especially with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have become a crucial protective measure in public health. Monitoring mask compliance in crowded places like airports, shopping malls, and public transport systems is essential for containing the spread of contagious diseases. This project aims to provide an automated solution using deep learning for face mask detection to ensure safety and compliance in such scenarios.

Theoretical Background
1. Object Detection with YOLOv5
YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that operates in real-time. Unlike traditional object detection models that apply a classifier to an image multiple times at different locations and scales, YOLOv5 divides the image into an SxS grid and applies a single neural network to the entire image. Each grid cell predicts bounding boxes and their associated class probabilities directly.

Key Advantages of YOLOv5:
Speed and Efficiency: Processes images faster than many other object detection models.
Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy with fewer false positives and false negatives.
Flexibility: Can be fine-tuned for various object detection tasks, including face mask detection.
2. Problem Formulation
The face mask detection problem is formulated as a multi-class object detection task, where the model identifies:

With Mask: Person is wearing a face mask properly.
Without Mask: Person is not wearing a face mask.
Mask Worn Incorrectly: Person is wearing a face mask incorrectly (e.g., under the nose or on the chin).
3. Dataset Preparation
A high-quality dataset is essential for training an effective object detection model. The dataset used in this project contains images of people wearing masks, not wearing masks, and wearing masks incorrectly. The images are annotated with bounding boxes that indicate the location of faces and the corresponding class labels.

Data Annotation: Each image is annotated to create bounding boxes around faces and labeled according to the mask category.
Data Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and color adjustment are used to increase the variability in the dataset, helping the model generalize better.
4. Model Training
The YOLOv5 model is trained using the annotated dataset. The training involves optimizing the model weights to minimize the loss function, which is a combination of classification loss, localization loss (bounding box regression), and confidence loss.

Transfer Learning: The training starts with a pre-trained YOLOv5 model (e.g., YOLOv5s) on a large-scale object detection dataset like COCO. This helps in faster convergence and better performance by leveraging pre-learned features.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and image size are tuned to achieve the best results.
5. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using several metrics:

Precision: Measures the accuracy of the positive predictions.
Recall: Measures the ability of the model to find all positive instances.
Mean Average Precision (mAP): A common metric in object detection that considers both precision and recall.
Inference Time: Time taken by the model to process each image, which is crucial for real-time applications.
6. Model Inference and Deployment
Once trained, the YOLOv5 model can be used for inference on new images or videos. The model outputs bounding boxes around detected faces with labels indicating mask status.

Real-Time Detection: The model can be integrated into systems requiring real-time detection, such as CCTV surveillance or mobile applications.
Deployment: The model can be deployed on cloud platforms or edge devices depending on the application requirements. Techniques like model quantization can be used to optimize performance on edge devices.
Conclusion
The face mask prediction project using YOLOv5 provides an efficient and accurate solution for monitoring face mask compliance in real-time. It leverages the power of deep learning and advanced object detection techniques to achieve robust performance, making it suitable for deployment in various real-world scenarios.
